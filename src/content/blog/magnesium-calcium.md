# Magnesium & Calcium: The Dynamic Duo Your Body Needs (2024 Guide)

Did you ever wonder why these two minerals are often paired together in supplements? As someone who's spent years researching nutritional supplements, I can tell you that the relationship between magnesium and calcium is fascinating – and understanding it could be the key to better health.

3. Calcium lactate – often used in food fortification; easily absorbed.
4. Calcium gluconate – another easily absorbed form, but contains less elemental calcium.

### Magnesium Forms:
1. Magnesium citrate – highly bioavailable, helpful for digestion.
2. Magnesium glycinate – gentle on the stomach, great for anxiety and sleep.
3. Magnesium oxide – higher elemental magnesium, but less bioavailable; useful for digestion.
4. Magnesium malate – often used for muscle pain and fatigue.

## Timing Tips
- **For calcium**: Avoid taking calcium with high doses of iron or zinc, as they can interfere with absorption. 
- **For magnesium**: Take in the evening, especially if you’re using it to support sleep.
